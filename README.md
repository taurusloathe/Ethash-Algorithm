# Ethash-Algorithm
Improvements made to the algorithm to potentially enhance mining efficiency:

# Parallelization with NumPy: 
Utilization of NumPy to perform array operations in parallel, leveraging its optimized C implementation.

# GPU Acceleration with CUDA: 
Implementation of GPU acceleration using CUDA, which allows us to offload computation to the GPU for parallel processing.

# Optimization of Hash Functions:
Investigates faster hash functions or algorithms that can provide similar cryptographic properties with better performance.

Please note that implementing GPU acceleration requires CUDA-compatible hardware and the CuPy library installed, which provides NumPy-like syntax for GPU computing. Additionally, the performance gains may vary depending on factors such as hardware configuration, algorithm complexity, and dataset size.
