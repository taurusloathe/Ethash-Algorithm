# Ethash-Algorithm
Improvements made to the algorithm to enhance mining efficiency:

# Parallelization with CuPy: 
This can generate the DAG in batches, utilizing CuPy's ability to perform parallel computations on the GPU.
Memory efficiency is improved by reducing unnecessary memory transfers and allocations.
The DAG generation process is parallelized, leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.
These optimizations should help improve the efficiency of the DAG generation process and overall performance of the Ethash algorithm.

# GPU Acceleration with CUDA: 
Implementation of GPU acceleration using CUDA, which allows us to offload computation to the GPU for parallel processing.

# Optimization of Hash Functions:
Investigates faster hash functions or algorithms that can provide similar cryptographic properties with better performance.

Be sure to update the network hashrate and the target block time as needed. Note that implementing GPU acceleration requires CUDA-compatible hardware and the CuPy library installed, which provides NumPy-like syntax for GPU computing. The performance gains may vary depending on hardware configuration.
